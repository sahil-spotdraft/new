Structure
=========
- Memento: This class stores the state of the object.
- Originator: The object whose state we want to save or restore. It creates a memento containing its internal state and can restore its state from a memento.
- Caretaker: The class responsible for managing the mementos. It requests mementos from the originator and stores them, but it doesn't modify or examine the content of the memento.
